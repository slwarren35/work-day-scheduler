# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

* Tasks can be entered for time blocks during the weekday.
* When a user enters the task and clicks the save button attached to the task the task is stored in local storage.
* The scheduler color codes the time block based on whether the time block is in the past, future or present.
* Upon load, the calendar presents the current day and time and stays updated while the scheduler is open.
